TODO:

  - document ModuleRotatingRouter3 on website
  - try to make highpass filter
  - add arpeggiation to mumbler instead of rotation
  - improve arpeggiation module
  - make videos of all synths (clickers is next)
  - create 12-bit equation player
  - pitch shifter using ring buffer
  - ring mod
  
Programming notes
  - Do _not_ put a delay() immediately before polling the analog inputs as it can
    cause inaccuracies in the voltage readings.  (Perhaps a bug in the Arduino
    implementation of delay()?)
