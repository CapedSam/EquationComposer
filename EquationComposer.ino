  Note: When using any bytebeat tool, make sure to set the output rate to 44,100  

TODO:
  - change map function to not map constant inputs
  - create add/subtract module
  - consider splitting ModuleLFO into: ModuleLFO(int rate) and ModuleVCLFO() 
  - use better datatypes than the uint32_t that I use everywhere out of laziness
  
Programming notes
  - Do _not_ put a delay() immediately before polling the analog inputs as it can
    cause inaccuracies in the voltage readings.  (Perhaps a bug in the Arduino
    implementation of delay()?)
